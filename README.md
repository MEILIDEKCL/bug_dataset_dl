# bug_dataset_dl
This is for getting log of file change in github.
And our target program is DL, like tensorflow, pytorch and so on.
We crawl the pull requests submitted on GitHub, extracting all file changes. We are only interested in files with the extensions ".cc" or ".py". Finally, we will also simplify and manually process the results.
